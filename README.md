# 🐍 Python List Operations Demo

This simple Python script demonstrates basic operations on a list, including appending, inserting, extending, removing, sorting, and finding the index of an element. It's a great starting point for beginners learning how to manipulate lists in Python.

## 📋 Features

The script performs the following operations step-by-step:

1. **Create an empty list**
2. **Append elements**: Adds `10`, `20`, `30`, and `40` to the list.
3. **Insert an element**: Inserts `15` at index `1`.
4. **Extend the list**: Adds `[50, 60, 70]` to the end of the list.
5. **Remove the last element**: Uses `pop()` to remove the last item.
6. **Sort the list**: Sorts the list in ascending order.
7. **Find an index**: Finds the index of the value `30`.

## 🧠 Learning Objectives

- Understand how to use `append()`, `insert()`, `extend()`, and `pop()` methods.
- Learn how to sort a list using `sort()`.
- Use `index()` to find the position of an element.
- Practice reading and modifying list data structures.
